# How it works
The AI Scoop works by:
* Parsing the relevant information, pictures, and content from the article (works for any news/informational website)
* Applying a series of NLP AI algorithms to:
  1. **Summarize** the article's text
  2. **Simplify** the language to make the content kid-friendly.
* Our back end generates additional magazine activities, such as a word search containing key vocabulary words from the article and their definitions.
* Once we process the article, the content and activities are loaded into our highly attractive Figma-designed UI to generate a magazine which can be saved/printed by the user.
