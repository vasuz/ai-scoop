# How it works
The AI Scoop works by:
* Parsing the relevant information, pictures, and content from the article (works for any news/informational website)
* Applying an NLP AI algorithm to **summarize** the article's contents and **simplify** them in order to make the materials kid-friendly.
* Our back end generates additional magazine activities, such as a word search containing key vocabulary words from the article and their definitions.
* Once we process the article, the content and activities are loaded into our highly attractive Figma-designed UI to generate a magazine which can be saved/printed by the user.

# Our Goal
* Our goal is, first and foremost, is to make learning more fun and engaging for kids.
* Overworked/underpaid teachers can quickly use our website to create content, and save several hours each week cultivating articles/creating activities/formatting it themselves.
* Our product allows them to have a better work-life balance and spend time on other, more rewarding parts of teaching.
* Parents can read the original article and use our website for their kids, and then discuss the content after with their kids. Education **and** bonding!
